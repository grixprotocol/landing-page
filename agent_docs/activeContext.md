Currently, I'm updating the memory bank with the initial context for the landing page project. The recent changes include documenting the product context and preparing for future development updates. Next steps involve defining system patterns, technical context, and updating folder indexes as development continues.

I've analyzed the codebase and found that the page's events and activity are tracked using Mixpanel. The implementation is located in `src/services/analytics.ts`. The analytics service initializes Mixpanel with a specific token and configuration, including custom API routes and headers. The service provides methods for tracking various events:

1. `identify` - For identifying users
2. `track` - For tracking general events
3. `trackPageInteraction` - For tracking interactions with page content
4. `trackLaunchApp` - For tracking when users launch the app
5. `trackSocialLink` - For tracking clicks on social media links

These tracking methods are used in components like the header (for tracking "Launch App" button clicks) and footer (for tracking social media link clicks). Additionally, the app uses Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics as shown in the layout.tsx file.

Recent updates:
- Added PostHog as an additional analytics tracker alongside Mixpanel
- Installed the posthog-js package
- Implemented PostHog using the recommended Next.js app router approach:
  - Updated `src/app/providers.tsx` to initialize PostHog and provide the PostHog context
  - Added automatic page view tracking with proper Next.js routing integration
  - Removed the PostHog initialization from analytics.ts since it's now handled in providers.tsx
- Modified the analytics service to send events to both Mixpanel and PostHog
- Maintained the same event names and properties structure between both systems
- The PostHog implementation requires the user to replace 'YOUR_POSTHOG_API_KEY' with their actual API key in the providers.tsx file
